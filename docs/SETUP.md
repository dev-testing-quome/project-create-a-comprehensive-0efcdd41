# Developer Setup Guide - project-create-a-comprehensive

This guide outlines the setup process for developers working on "project-create-a-comprehensive," a legal case management system.

## Prerequisites

* **Required Software Versions:**
    * Python 3.9+
    * Node.js 16+
    * PostgreSQL 14+ (or compatible database)
    * Docker & Docker Compose (Recommended for Option 1)

* **Development Tools:**
    * Git
    * Text editor or IDE (VS Code recommended)

* **IDE Recommendations and Configurations:**
    * **VS Code:** Install extensions for Python, JavaScript, and PostgreSQL.  Configure linters (e.g., Pylint, ESLint) and formatters (e.g., Black, Prettier) based on the project's `.editorconfig` and `.eslintrc` files (these files will be provided in the project repository).


## Local Development Setup

### Option 1: Docker Development (Recommended)

1. **Clone Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd project-create-a-comprehensive
   ```

2. **Docker Setup:** Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running on your system.

3. **Development `docker-compose.yml` Configuration:** The project repository will include a `docker-compose.yml` file defining the services (database, backend, frontend).  This file will manage the containers and their interconnections.  Example:

   ```yaml
   version: "3.9"
   services:
     db:
       image: postgres:14
       environment:
         - POSTGRES_USER=your_db_user
         - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_db_password
         - POSTGRES_DB=your_db_name
       ports:
         - "5432:5432"
     backend:
       build: ./backend
       ports:
         - "8000:8000"
       depends_on:
         - db
       environment:
         - DATABASE_URL=postgres://your_db_user:your_db_password@db:5432/your_db_name
     frontend:
       build: ./frontend
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"
       depends_on:
         - backend
   ```

4. **Hot Reload Setup:**  The backend (if using frameworks like Flask or Django) and frontend (using tools like webpack or similar) should have hot reload enabled for faster development.  Configuration details will be provided in the respective project directories (`backend` and `frontend`).


### Option 2: Native Development

1. **Backend Setup:**
   * Create a Python virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv .venv
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
   * Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
     ```
2. **Frontend Setup:**
   * Install Node.js and npm.
   * Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd frontend`
   * Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
3. **Database Setup:**
   * Install PostgreSQL.
   * Create a database user and database.
   * Configure the database connection details (see Environment Configuration).


## Environment Configuration

* **Required Environment Variables:**  The `.env` file will contain variables like `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET_KEY`, `EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_PORT`, API keys for external services.  A sample `.env` file will be provided.

* **Local Development `.env` File Setup:** Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with your local development configurations.  **Never commit `.env` files to version control.**

* **Configuration for Different Environments:**  Environment variables will be managed differently for development, staging, and production (e.g., using environment variables, configuration files, or secrets management services).


## Running the Application

1. **Start Commands (Docker):**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

2. **Start Commands (Native):**
   * Backend:  (depends on framework - example for Flask): `python backend/manage.py runserver`
   * Frontend: `npm start`

3. **Access Frontend and Backend:** The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or a different port specified in your configuration). The backend API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000` (or your backend's specified port).

4. **API Documentation Access:**  Swagger or similar documentation will be generated, accessible through a specific endpoint in the backend (e.g., `/api/docs`).


## Development Workflow

* **Git Workflow and Branching Strategy:**  Use Gitflow or a similar branching strategy (e.g., `main` branch for production, feature branches for development).

* **Code Formatting and Linting Setup:**  Use tools like Black (Python) and Prettier (JavaScript) for consistent code formatting and ESLint/Pylint for linting.

* **Testing Procedures:**  Write unit and integration tests using appropriate frameworks (e.g., pytest for Python, Jest for JavaScript).

* **Debugging Setup:**  Utilize your IDE's debugging tools and logging mechanisms.


## Database Management

* **Running Migrations:**  Use database migration tools (e.g., Alembic for SQLAlchemy in Python) to manage database schema changes.

* **Seeding Development Data:**  Use scripts to populate the database with sample data for development and testing.

* **Database Reset Procedures:**  Provide scripts to easily reset the database to a clean state.


## Testing

* **Running Unit Tests:**  Run unit tests using the project's testing framework (e.g., `pytest` for Python, `jest` for JavaScript).

* **Running Integration Tests:**  Run integration tests to verify interactions between different components.

* **Test Coverage Reports:**  Generate test coverage reports to track test completeness.


## Common Development Tasks

* **Adding New API Endpoints:**  Follow the project's API design guidelines and write tests.

* **Adding New Frontend Components:**  Use the project's frontend framework and style guide.

* **Database Schema Changes:**  Use database migrations to manage schema changes.

* **Adding Dependencies:**  Update `requirements.txt` (backend) and `package.json` (frontend) and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and `npm install`.


## Troubleshooting

* **Common Setup Issues:**  Check the logs for error messages.

* **Port Conflicts Resolution:**  Change ports in the configuration files.

* **Dependency Issues:**  Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly and compatible.

* **Environment Variable Problems:**  Verify that environment variables are set correctly.


## Contributing

* **Code Style Guidelines:**  Follow the project's code style guidelines (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, Airbnb style guide for JavaScript).

* **Pull Request Process:**  Create pull requests with clear descriptions and relevant tests.

* **Issue Reporting:**  Use the project's issue tracker to report bugs and feature requests.


This guide provides a comprehensive starting point.  Specific details and commands may vary depending on the project's chosen technologies and frameworks.  Refer to the project's README and documentation for more detailed instructions.
