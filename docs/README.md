* Modern frontend built with React and TypeScript for a responsive and user-friendly experience.
* Dockerized for easy deployment and consistent environment management.


## Technology Stack

* **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11+)
* **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
* **Database**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM (easily swappable for PostgreSQL, MySQL etc.)
* **Containerization**: Docker
* **Testing**:  (Specify testing framework, e.g., pytest, Jest)


## Prerequisites

* Python 3.11 or higher
* Node.js 18 or higher
* npm or yarn
* Docker (optional, but recommended for deployment)
* Git


## Installation

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd project-create-a-comprehensive
```

2. **Backend Setup:**

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Frontend Setup:**

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

4. **Start the Application:**

```bash
# Run the backend in a separate terminal
cd ../backend
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Run the frontend in another separate terminal
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
```


### Docker Setup

1.  Navigate to the project root directory.
2.  Run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will build and start both the frontend and backend containers.


## API Documentation

Once the application is running, you can access the interactive API documentation at:

* **Swagger UI:** http://localhost:8000/docs
* **ReDoc:** http://localhost:8000/redoc


## Usage

**Key Endpoints (Examples):**

* `/cases`:  GET to retrieve a list of cases, POST to create a new case.  Requires authentication.
* `/cases/{case_id}`: GET to retrieve a specific case, PUT to update a case, DELETE to delete a case. Requires authentication.
* `/clients`: Manage client information. Requires authentication.
* `/documents`: Manage case documents (upload, download). Requires authentication.
* `/auth/login`:  Authenticate a user.


**Sample Request (GET /cases):**

```bash
GET /cases HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>
```

**Sample Response (GET /cases):**

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "case_name": "Smith v. Jones",
    "client_id": 123,
    // ... other case details
  },
  // ... more cases
]
```

*(Note:  Specific endpoints and request/response structures will be detailed in the API documentation.)*


**Common Workflows:**

1.  User authentication and authorization.
2.  Creating a new case, adding client information, and uploading documents.
3.  Scheduling court dates and setting deadlines with automated reminders.
4.  Tracking time spent on tasks and generating invoices.
5.  Managing client communication through the secure messaging system.
